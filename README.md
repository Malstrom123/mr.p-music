## UX

### Project Goals 

The primary goal for this site is to give information about our new releases, tour and biography.

#### Audience/Fans Goals

Audience/Fans goals are:
- A large video that highlights us when we're performing live.
- Minimal buttons for easy navigation.
- Ticket purchase.
- A Biography about us.
- New releses
- Tour Dates

#### Developer and Business Goals

- I will be using the programming languages HTML5 and CSS3.
- A polished experience for the user, with both high-quality visuals and sound.
- A portfolio project to be proud of.

#### User Stories 

1. Easy to understand. 
2. Big, user-friendly buttons that are easy to click.
3. Visual icons for social media and spotify.
4. A dedicated page for tickets, music, and biography.

### Design Choices

The website should feel like you're experiencing a live show. 

**Fonts**

-The primary typeface is 'Cal Sans'. I chose it because it is clean and easy to read. 

-The secondary typeface is 'Inter'. It’s clean and simple, but distinct from the primary one.

**Icons**

-The icons on the page all serve a purpose, and everyone knows what they mean.

**Colors**

**Styling**

-The theme of the website will be quite dark, but what needs to stand out will be highlighted so you don't miss anything.

-Cards and container boxes there will be sharp corners throughout the website to keep everything consistent.

**Background**

-The background on the homepage will consist of a video from one of our performances.

-The background for our tour schedule will be black and simple. 

-The background for our music will be black.

**Images**

-The images on the website will be from our live performances and cover art to our songs.

**Audiofiles**

-You will not be able to listen to the songs on the website. Instead, there will be links to Spotify.
